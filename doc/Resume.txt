YUSUF FAJAR MUKTI
Enterprise BI (Data Engineer)

I believe data is one of the tools that could guide human to a more rational decision. To use data for our advantage means mastering its end-to-end process, 
from  ingestion  to  reporting.  Therefore,  I  am  skilled  in  SQL,  Extract  Transform  and  Load  (ETL)  pipeline  development,  combined  with  Metabase  dashboard 
visualization as well as storytelling skill, economics knowledge, and business acumen to derive wisdom from data, as highlighted by my experiences in academic 
research, data analyst, and data engineering.  I enjoy the process of automating task and the efﬁcieny that it produces
